🛡️ Project Overview: Ransomware Attack Simulation

This project is a simulation of a ransomware attack designed for educational and research purposes only. It demonstrates the key components typically involved in such a scenario:

    💻 Ransomware Payload (C Language): Core ransomware logic developed in C for simulating file encryption on the victim's machine.

    🐍 Python-based Server: Hosts and serves the malicious payload.

    📧 Phishing Email: Simulated phishing email used to deliver the payload to the victim.

    💬 Chat Website: Mimics communication between the attacker and the victim.

    🔐 Decryption Portal: A separate website to simulate the key recovery or payment interface.

    ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is strictly for educational purposes. Do not use it for malicious or unauthorized activities.
